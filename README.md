### Starting the frontend development server
To install the project dependencies for the frontend, open the terminal and make sure that the current directory is `yepstr-react-test`. You can then run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed for the project (This has to be done only once).

To start the frontend server run `npm start` from the `yepstr-react-test` directory.
